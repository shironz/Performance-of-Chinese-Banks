# Performance-of-Chinese-Banks
Abstract:

This paper examines the performance of Chinese commercial banks before, during, and after the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2008--2010 China's 4 trillion Renminbi stimulus plan. Fully nonparametric methods are used to estimate technical efficiencies. Recently-developed statistical results are used to test for changes in efficiencies as well as productivity over time, and to test for changes in technology over time. We also test for differences in efficiency and productivity between big and small banks, and between domestic and foreign banks. We find evidence of the non-convexity of banks' production set. The data reveal that technical efficiency declined at the start of the global financial crisis (2007--2008) and after the China's stimulus plan (2010--2011), but recovered in the years later (2011--2013), and declined again from 2013 to 2014, ending lower in 2014 than in 2007. We find that productivity declined during and just after the China's stimulus plan (2009--2011), but recovered in the years later (2013--2014), ending lower in 2014 than in 2007. We also find that the technology shifted downward from 2012 to 2013, and then shifted upward from 2013 to 2014. Over the period 2007--2014, technology shifted upward. We provide evidence that in general big banks were more efficient and productive than small banks. Finally, domestic banks had higher efficiency and productivity than foreign banks over this period except in 2008.
